# Usage Instructions:
    1. Create a folder in the mod folder called textures.
    2. Put any pictures of places you may add into the textures folder.
    3. Open places form by typing /places.
    4. Click "New Place".  (If you are informed that you have insufficient privileges, in chat type "/grant <playername> add_place" and repeat step 4)
    5. Enter a name (Your textures should be all lowercase and replace spaces with underscores.  The name can have capital letters and spaces but must be the same thing as the texture name.)
    6. In the coordinates field, input in this format: x,y,z  (No Brackets and no spaces)
    7. In the description, type a description of the place.
    8. Click Submit.
    
  # Further Notes:
    1. After completing steps to create a place you should see the main screen.
    2. Upon clicking a place, if the picture does not load and is a solid color, either the texture name is spelled wrong or there is not a texture there.
    
  # Things to know:
    1. If you type "/places" without a parameter, the place closest to you will be selected.
    2. If you type "/places <place_name>", if place_name is a valid place, that will be selected.  Else the nearest place will be selected.
    3. This mod has not been fully tested and may be prone to bugs.
